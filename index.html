            <h2>Why the Azores?</h2>
            <h3>Europe's secret islands of Adventure</h3>
            <p>
              The Azores Islands are a group of nine volcanic islands located in
              the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,500 kilometers west of
              mainland Portugal. The islands are known for their stunning
              natural beauty, with lush green landscapes, crystal-clear lakes,
              and dramatic cliffs plunging into the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Azores are also famous for their unique wildlife and
              biodiversity, with many endemic species found only on these
              islands. The archipelago is a popular destination for outdoor
              enthusiasts, offering activities such as hiking, whale watching,
              surfing, and diving. The Azores are also rich in culture and
              history, with a unique blend of Portuguese and Azorean traditions.

                <p>
                  Over 20 species of whales and dolphins either inhabit or pass
                  by the waters along their migratory routes, so that the Azores
                  are one of the very best spots in the world for Whale
                  Watching, arguably second to none.

                  The Azores have become one of the best case studies of how the
                  presence of whales and dolphins can be watched with great
                  educational value and full protection granted to the animals.
